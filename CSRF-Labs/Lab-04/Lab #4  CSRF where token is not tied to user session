Lab #4 - CSRF where token is not tied to user session
Vulnerable parameter - email change functionality
Goal - exploit the csrf vulnerability and change the email address
Creds - wiener:peter - carlos:montoya

Analysis:
In order for a csrf attack to be possible:
#- A relevant action - change a user email
#- Cookie based session handling - session cookie
#- No unpredictable request parameters - csrf token is not tied to user session

Testing CSRF Tokens
#- Remove the CSRF token nad see if application accepts requests
#- Change the request method from POST to GET
#- See if CSRF token is tied to user session (for specific user; So we login with 2nd user account, inspect element in change email bar and copy user session cookie of 2nd user then replaced it in burp 1st user request. I will bypass csrf token).
