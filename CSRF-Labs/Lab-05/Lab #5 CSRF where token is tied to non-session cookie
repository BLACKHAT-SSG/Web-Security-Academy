Lab #5 - CSRF where token is tied to non-session cookie
Vulnerable parameter - email change functionality
Goal - exploit the csrf vulnerability and change the email address
Creds - wiener:peter - carlos:montoya

Analysis:
In order for a csrf attack to be possible:
#- A relevant action - change a user email
#- Cookie based session handling - session cookie
#- No unpredictable request parameters - csrf token is not tied to user session

Testing CSRF Tokens
#- Remove the CSRF token nad see if application accepts requests
#- Change the request method from POST to GET
#- See if CSRF token is tied to user session 

Testing CSRF Token and CSRF cookies.
#- Check if the token is tied to the CSRF cookie (by providing wrong token value and check response in burp)
	-- Submit an invalid CSRF token
	-- Submit a valid CSRF token form another user (csrf token = IC3frToxSKTdfpD5RBIaeoSVJ9CIC8nn ). Invalid CSRF token response.
#- Submit a valid CSRF token and cookie from another user.
	-- csrf token = IC3frToxSKTdfpD5RBIaeoSVJ9CIC8nn 
	-- csrfFKey cookie = 8HcsyEke6ZRqdt9K06uu7z97WV0fiRZw
	-- This condition is valid and we redirect to 200 response in burp. 

#- In order to exploit this vulnerability, we need to perform 2 things.
	1. Inject a csrfkey cookie in the user session (HTTP Header injection). Satisfied
	2. Send a CSRF attack to the victim with a known csrf token.
