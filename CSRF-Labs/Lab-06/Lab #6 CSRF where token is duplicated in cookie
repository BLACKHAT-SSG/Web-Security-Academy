Creds - wiener:peter 

Analysis:
In order for a csrf attack to be possible:
#- A relevant action - change a user email
#- Cookie based session handling - session cookie
#- No unpredictable request parameters - csrf token is not tied to user session

Testing CSRF Tokens
#- Remove the CSRF token nad see if application accepts requests
#- Change the request method from POST to GET
#- See if CSRF token is tied to user session

Testing CSRF Token and CSRF cookies.
#- Check if the token is tied to the CSRF cookie (by providing wrong token value and check response in burp)
	-- Submit an invalid CSRF token
	-- Submit a valid CSRF token form another user
#- Submit a valid CSRF token and cookie from another user.

#- In order to exploit this vulnerability, we need to perform 2 things.
	1. Inject a csrf cookie in the user session (HTTP Header injection). Satisfied
	2. Send a CSRF attack to the victim with a known csrf token.
